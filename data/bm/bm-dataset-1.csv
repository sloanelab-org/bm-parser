This is one of a group of five drawings of Tupinamba in the album (the others are SL,5270,9r,v and 10r,v). They have recently been discussed in the exhibition catalogue, Kim Sloan, 'A New World: England's first view of America', London, BM, 2007, pp. 226-7,  the text of which follows here:  WATERCOLOURS OF TUPINAMBÁ INDIANS OF BRAZIL   In addition to versions of the Inuit, Indian and costume studies, the Sloane volume contains these five images of the Tupinambá from the Amazon in Brazil. They are not direct copies but certainly related to five woodcuts which appeared in Jean de Léry’s 'Histoire d’vn Voyage fait en la terre dv Bresil avtrement dite Amerique' (La Rochelle) in 1578 (fig. 148; all reproduced in PH&DBQ, pl. 148).   As Christian Feest has noted in Chapter 5, Hans Staden, working for the Portuguese who had controlled Brazil from 1500, was captured by a group of Tupinambá in 1553 and published an illustrated account of his year with them in 1557, which was in turn the basis for de Bry’s America part III in 1592. Also in 1557, André Thevet published his 'Les Singularitez de la France Antarctique avtrement nommee Amerique …' (Paris). Thevet was a Catholic, a cosmographer of the King of France and lived in the colony the French attempted to establish on the site of Rio di Janeiro. His account was also illustrated, although the images owed much to the invention of their Flemish engravers. Both Staden’s and Thevet’s accounts, with their shocking images of cannibalism and naked people with distinctive feather ornaments on their heads and buttocks, had an immediate impact on the European imagination and these became the identifying attributes of allegorical images representing all indigenous Americans, North and South, until and even long after John White’s and Le Moyne’s images appeared in Parts I and II of de Bry’s 'America' in the 1590s.  This collective idea of the inhabitants of the New World was reinforced by Thevet’s re-use of his images and variations of them in his 'Cosmographie Universelle … illustree de diverses figures' (Paris) in 1575 and his 'Les Vrais Pourtraits et vies des hommes illustres' (Paris) in 1584, both widely circulated. Jean de Léry, however, a Calvinist member of the same French colony as Thevet, actually fled to the Tupinambá because of the increasing hostility of the colony’s Catholic leader. He published his own 1578 account with its five woodcuts to which these watercolours relate, as a reply to Thevet and an attack on French Catholicism. De Léry wrote that he had lived amongst the Tupinambá for a year ‘so as I might conceive in my mind a certain idea or proportion of them, yet I say, by reason of their diverse gestures and behaviours, utterly different from ours, it is a very difficult matter to express their true proportion, either in writing or in painting: but if any one covet to enjoy the full pleasure of them, I could wish him to go into America himself’ (p. 129, cited in PH&DBQ 33). Just as Hakluyt, Harriot and de Bry were to do, Thevet emphasized the more civilized societal, familial and religious aspects of the lives of the Indians of America and employed his account as a tool of Protestant propaganda. He indicated that Catholic powers ruled through suppression with violence and slavery and were met by violence in return while the Protestant argument was that understanding the Indians, living amongst and working with them and teaching them the values of Christianity by example was the best way of achieving successful colonization in America.  De Léry adapted some of the features of Thevet’s illustrations for his own five woodcuts but isolated the figures, removing them from the landscape backgrounds that the engravers had provided and making them individual portraits and illustrating ceremonies just as John White’s and Le Moyne’s original watercolours were to do. The differences between these watercolours and de Lery’s woodcuts seem to indicate that the latter were not the direct source of these watercolours and there seems to have been an intermediate set of images, now lost.   Some of the images have been mounted on the backs of others; all are pen and brown ink with watercolour, heightened with lead pigments.   Lit.: LB 3 (2–5), ECM 78 (7–10), PH&DBQ 119–23 and PH 44–8.

See H.J. Braunholtz, Sir Hans Sloane and Ethnography 1970, pl.4; pp.10-11.  Text from Room 3 display, 2003: 'Among Sami people, a drum such as this was an important tool for survival. They were magical weapons that, in the hands of a skilled person, could help to protect the community. Magic drums were used by Sami for many generations, and this may be among the oldest surviving examples. The skin has layers of images, some worn or rubbed away, others added, perhaps through years of use.          In the 1600s Christian missionaries fiercely persecuted Sami people, associating their traditional beliefs with witchcraft. Some Sami added Christian imagery to their drums in an unsuccessful attempt to make them acceptable. Others continued to use drums in secret at great personal risk. By 1700 [?] most surviving Sami had been converted and almost all Sami magic drums had been destroyed.           The skin of this drum has several layers of symbols and drawings. These are divided into bands that refer to different levels of the Sami universe. Highlighted at the top of the drum are reindeer being herded by figures holding staves or branches. This could represent a successful hunt in the human world, or perhaps a hunt in the realm of spirits and gods. We have no direct record of what these images mean from the people who used or made the drum. Each symbol may have more than one meaning. But we can attempt to understand them based on stories handed down and retold by Sami, and on information from other societies living around the Arctic who still use similar drums today.           The images on the drum represent the personal visions and experiences of a shaman, or noaidi, which he sketched out to represent his dangerous journey through the different levels of the Sami universe to communicate with spirits. The lower part of the drum may represent the Sami underworld. You can see highlighted the outline of a figure steering a boat across the great underworld sea. This may have associations with the moon, which appears behind the figure. Underworld boats are also associated with the sun, which is carried by boat every night on its return journey to a new sunrise. The sun image is repeated several times, representing its daily journey across the sky from east to west, as well as its return journey through the underworld. The sun outlined [in x] is just cresting the horizon, possibly referring to the winter solstice, the darkest time of year, but also important as a time of transition.            Sami people, once known as the Lapps, live in arctic and sub-arctic Europe. Their homeland, named Sapmi, covers parts of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, as well as the Kola Peninsula in Russia. The area is marked on maps to your left. For almost three thousand years Sami lived as hunters and gatherers. But from about 1500 they became semi-nomadic, herding reindeer and trapping animals in the north, fishing along the coast and farming in the south. Today there are about 100,000 Sami. Although most live in towns and cities, rural life is still at the heart of Sami identity. The images on the magic drum, of reindeer herding, fishing and the winter solstice, remain important cultural symbols for Sami people. They represent continuity with the land and their ancestors.            For Sami people there was more to the world than the surface appearance of things. There were parallel worlds that could be entered through dreams and trance. It was here that you could find the powers and spirits that controlled daily life in the waking world. One of the most important people in a Sami community was the shaman, or 'noaidi', someone who could communicate between these worlds. The most vital tool of a 'noaidi' was his drum. In front of a flickering fire, he would take the drum and beat it rhythmically in a public performance, using the sound like a drug to enter a trance. In this altered state, he could transform into other creatures, or even into a breath of wind, to enter the world of dreams. Here he negotiated with the spirits over disease and death, life and fertility, fish and game, good weather and storms.             The skin of the drum on display is now loose and cannot be played, but its sound might have been similar to the drumming used in Yoik music. Yoik refers to one of several traditional types of Sami chanting.' (Robert Storrie)  For further discussion of Sámi drums, see 'Peasant Art in Sweden, Lapland and  Iceland', Autumn Number of 'The Studio' 1910, section on Lapland, p. 37,  and Veli-Pekka Lehtola, 'The Sámi people: Traditions in Transition', University of Alaska Press 2004, p. 29. See also exhibition catalogue, 'Sámi Dáidda' (Sámi art), Nordiskt Konstcentrum, Helsinki 1981, p. 58-9, pl. 14.          The drum is probably from the region of Pite, north of Vapsten, Sweden  or the central Sàmi region in view of the images depicted (information supplied by Morten Olsen Haugen, November 2014).",shammond,16 Jul 2009,,,,,L~W~X,39.00~33.50~10.00,~~,cm~cm~cm,~~,,Arctic: Culture and Climate,"Encountering weather gods The images drawn with alder-bark pigment  on this wooden and reindeer-hide drum depict encounters between a noaidi , a Sámi spiritual expert, and various gods, including Fertility and Thunder.

Rock crystal is also known as shuiyu (水玉) or 'water jade' and was understood to be petrified water. Crystal has long been prized in China for its purity and clarity, qualities that made it popular among the literati of Imperail China with their respect for learning and uprightness.
